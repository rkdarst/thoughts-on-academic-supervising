<h1>About this guide<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-guide" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Hopefully, this guide becomes the collection of opinions form many
different people.  Below, you can read about the general plan.</p>
<p>This book is focused on technical or computational sciences (so far?).</p>
<section id="why-management">
<h2>Why management?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-management" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once one becomes a leader, one of their responsibility is to get the
best out of the people they lead.  We often hear horror stories about
management, including the joke “the best manager I’ve had is one who
did nothing”.  Still, working life is difficult, especially in
academia, and <em>good</em> management/leadership <em>is</em> actually important
both for students and group leaders.</p>

<h2>Prologue: Richard Darst<a class="headerlink" href="#prologue-richard-darst" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>(more prologues will be added for other contributors)</p>
<p>When I started as a manager, not of research students but of research
staff, I put some thought into understanding what my responsibilities
would be.  What I found wasn’t very pretty: most researchers/students
I knew didn’t have very good managers, I had good supervisors but
perhaps not good managers, and the whole idea of academic management
was vague and unclear.  This leads to catastrophically low
productivity and research output.</p>
<p>Of course, this might be by design: do we want our students and staff
to have the freedom to do what they want and try and fail?  Yes, that
seems like a good idea.  But that doesn’t mean they have to be alone
and without good mentoring.  And if we don’t put in effort in
advising, the outcome of the academic system only reenforces existing
power structures and inequalities in academia.</p>
<p>I’m not a research group leader (professor), but I think that is a
good thing.  Instead, I work as professional university staff
(scientific computing support) and am young enough to still be closely
connected to junior researchers.  In my role as a supporter, I see
(and help with) many of the problems that should be solved at the
group management level, whether they are technical or social.  Since I
have started supervising my own staff, I can really connect to best
practices of research-type staff.  On top of that, as busy as I am, I
have more time than most group leaders to devote to writing this.  I
won’t know everything, but it’s open source so others can improve.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that there is a lot that needs to be better.  Everyone
will need to find their own style, but by writing down some notes
hopefully everyone can be helped to find it.  Equally, by writing
things down, students and research staff can also benefit by being
able to understand different management styles and discuss what they
need with their own advisors (or find a properly matched advisor in
the first place).</p>

<p>The intention is that this is an open-source project, with many
different opinions.  Of course, since many things contained in it are
opinions, it is a rather interesting open-source project.  For now,
most of the content is the result of one author, but as time goes on
this page will be changed to reflect reality.  Major contributors can
add their own epilogues for this page.</p>
<p>It is best to assume that any good ideas come from other contributors
and any bad ideas come from the initial author rkdarst.</p>

<p>The book <a class="reference external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/">The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating
Growth and Change</a> by Camille Fournier served as inspiration for this
guide.  In fact, you could go so far as to say that most of the basic
ideas of this guide come from here, with added commentary and
interpretation for the academic setting.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../credits/"><span class="doc">credits page</span></a> will list contributors who wish to
