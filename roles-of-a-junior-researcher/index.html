<h1>Roles of a junior researcher<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-of-a-junior-researcher" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>In order to understand the difficulty of management in academia, we
need to look at the different (and contradictory) roles into which
junior researchers are placed.  These conflicting roles are probably
the reason that bad management in academia is so pervasive.</p>
<p>This description is designed to cover people in the range from
research assistant to PhD student to postdocs.</p>
<section id="student">
<h2>Student<a class="headerlink" href="#student" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A student is someone studying to improve their knowledge, often with
their knowledge being evaluated and leading to some sort of recognition.
While not technically true, the joke that postdocs are “super-students
but don’t end up with a degree” is a bit too realistic for comfort.</p>
<p>A student can’t leave early without having wasted time by not earning
their degree.  This is a rather precarious position when the student
is entirely dependent on one person, and we’ll come back to this later.</p>
<p>Advantages: it places the emphasis on self-learning and
self-exploration.  A student can really choose their own path.  In
theory, it produces a credential that will assist in the student’s
future career - in addition to useful knowledge and skills, of course.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: we can sometimes leave people alone too much to do
their own thing, without providing needed advice and direction when it
would be in their own interest.  Being a student also implies some
sort of evaluation/scoring, and that a student needs to be
allowed to fail, otherwise their credentials eventually won’t mean
anything.  Since we often don’t like giving negative feedback
to people, so this part can often be lost so that they both don’t get
a negative score (to improve later) and don’t fully succeed.</p>
</section>
<section id="employee">
<h2>Employee<a class="headerlink" href="#employee" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>An employee works for an employer, and the employer dictates the work,
behavior, tools, working time, and so on.  “Employee vs independent
contractor” is a major point of debate in the current gig economy, so
one can find plenty of information on this topic online <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.  Often times,
researchers have far more freedom than an employee would, sometimes
only rarely working with others in the group on projects, deciding
their own tools, and of course working far more hours than HR thinks
you should.  (We discuss this more in the next section on independent
contractors.)</p>
<aside class="footnote-list brackets">
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="id2" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id1">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>For example US Internal Revenue Service guidelines on employee
vs independent contractor: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762">https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762</a></p>
</aside>
</aside>
<p>Whatever the case, “employee status” provides the most protection for
labor and is often used as (a part of) the academic hiring model, even
if someone is a student at the same time.</p>
<p>Sometimes researchers might not actually be employees (in the HR
sense), for example if they have an external grant or are unfunded.
In some cases this can cause problems for them because of missing
labor protections or not being “in the system” like others.  You
should be aware of this situation and be proactive about any problems
that may come up.</p>
<p>Advantages: provides a strong, well-defined relationship and good
worker protections.  Implies that the researcher works for the
organization, thus the organization should help them be as productive
as possible out of their own self-interest.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: This model is actually not accurate in many cases,
where the emphasis is on academic freedom and developing one’s own
research program (see next section).  HR, not understanding the true
relationship, may provide a lot of advice that isn’t very relevant to
this reality while thinking they are doing what is needed - leaving a
vacuum if there is no other outside support.  Employment contract and
study periods may be un-synced.  The aspect of student evaluation may
be under-emphasized.  Problems may be passed to HR, when really it
should be handled in an academic sense.  Labor legislation tries to
impose a structure which just doesn’t match reality, leading to
ignoring (at best) or actively fighting against other actually
important rules at worse.</p>
<p>In short, HR (actually “employee relations” in a university)can’t
provided everything needed for your group’s support needs.</p>
</section>
<section id="independent-contractor">
<h2>Independent contractor<a class="headerlink" href="#independent-contractor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>An independent contractor decides their own projects, tools, working
methods, and schedule - within a goal defined by the party contracting
them.  This sounds a lot like most researchers that I know of.
Especially the concept of bringing your own tools (techniques you
know) and methods (how you approach a problem), which you are likely
to have brought from previous jobs and will keep using in future ones
is quite like a freelancer.  An academic often has the freedom to
decline projects they don’t like.  This (and the “entrepreneur” case below)
are especially relevant when the researcher provides their own
funding.</p>
<p>TODO: Employee vs independent contractor table</p>
<p>Advantages: We accept the amount of freedom and independence
researchers have, and by accepting that, we can better tune our
management to their (and our) needs.  We realize that we suggest, not
tell, most of the time.  Researchers build up skills and
tools over time and can easily move around, sharing knowledge.  The
independent contractor model acknowledges mobility.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: If this model was the actual legal relationship, it
would be like running one’s own small business which is not a very
stable occupation and a very hard life (actually… academics have a
pretty hard life due to instability.  That’s the point, isn’t it?).
It is harder to run a research group creating long-term results when
everyone can do their own thing, or if they do focus on a project you
want, they might use some incompatible tool which no one else later
can use (un-reproducible research).  It is very easy to let someone
keep doing something unproductive for a very long time, since after
all, you can’t tell them what to do (and you just hire someone else
next time).  Especially when someone provides their own funding, it
can be difficult to provide hard-to-hear negative feedback.</p>
</section>
<section id="entrepreneur">
<h2>Entrepreneur<a class="headerlink" href="#entrepreneur" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Some researchers aim to become group leaders themselves, too.  In
order to do this, you have to practically come up with an idea and
sell it to others in your field, and then sell it to funding agencies.
This is a very, very different skill than what is traditionally
considered part of scientific education.  It is a very different skill
than being an employee.  You could say that most of academic is built
around this selling.</p>
<p>Advantages: For many people, this level of self-direction (while still
having the protections of an employee) is very appealing.  It gives
the freedom everyone wants.  It makes it very clear that to succeed,
you need to sell your ideas to others.  Competition gives the best ideas.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: There is very little training or support for this.  The
people who can best advance in this system aren’t necessarily the best
scientifically, but the best salespeople.  The tricks of the trade are
often learned passively or inherited through ones advisor, or not at
all.  We could debate conflicts of interest in a university supporting
entrepreneurs creating their own work to take elsewhere. Competition
holds everyone back.</p>
</section>
<section id="early-career-worker">
<h2>Early-career worker<a class="headerlink" href="#early-career-worker" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s not forget that, in addition to all of the above, young
researchers are essentially brand new people in working life, even if
their title is student.  In any normal company, there is a transition
period between learning theoretical knowledge during studies and being
a productive employee.  This is a quite hands-on, practical, and
mentorship-based kind of activity.  Academic researchers often miss
this type of period and end up having to learn to be self-sufficient
by themselves even if this is what we hope the young period provides
(since as we’ll discuss later, the mentorship often isn’t as great as
it should be).</p>
<p>If this aspect isn’t properly considered, a researcher may end up years
later without being ready to take any non-academic job at a level
consistent with their experience - since they aren’t prepared for any
other working life.</p>
