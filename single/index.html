<p>Once you start leading people, you have a different job.  You are no
longer responsible for doing things yourself, but to get the best out
of the people who work for you.  Given the amount of stress and
problems that young researchers tend to have, it’s worth thinking
about this role some.</p>

<h3>Why management?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-management" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once one becomes a leader, one of their responsibility is to get the
best out of the people they lead.  We often hear horror stories about
management, including the joke “the best manager I’ve had is one who
did nothing”.  Still, working life is difficult, especially in
academia, and <em>good</em> management/leadership <em>is</em> actually important
both for students and group leaders.</p>
</section>
<section id="prologue-richard-darst">
<h3>Prologue: Richard Darst<a class="headerlink" href="#prologue-richard-darst" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>(more prologues will be added for other contributors)</p>
<p>When I started as a manager, not of research students but of research
staff, I put some thought into understanding what my responsibilities
would be.  What I found wasn’t very pretty: most researchers/students
I knew didn’t have very good managers, I had good supervisors but
perhaps not good managers, and the whole idea of academic management
was vague and unclear.  This leads to catastrophically low
productivity and research output.</p>
<p>Of course, this might be by design: do we want our students and staff
to have the freedom to do what they want and try and fail?  Yes, that
seems like a good idea.  But that doesn’t mean they have to be alone
and without good mentoring.  And if we don’t put in effort in
advising, the outcome of the academic system only reenforces existing
power structures and inequalities in academia.</p>
<p>I’m not a research group leader (professor), but I think that is a
good thing.  Instead, I work as professional university staff
(scientific computing support) and am young enough to still be closely
connected to junior researchers.  In my role as a supporter, I see
(and help with) many of the problems that should be solved at the
group management level, whether they are technical or social.  Since I
have started supervising my own staff, I can really connect to best
practices of research-type staff.  On top of that, as busy as I am, I
have more time than most group leaders to devote to writing this.  I
won’t know everything, but it’s open source so others can improve.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that there is a lot that needs to be better.  Everyone
will need to find their own style, but by writing down some notes
hopefully everyone can be helped to find it.  Equally, by writing
things down, students and research staff can also benefit by being
able to understand different management styles and discuss what they
need with their own advisors (or find a properly matched advisor in
the first place).</p>

<h2>Roles of a junior researcher<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-of-a-junior-researcher" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In order to understand the difficulty of management, we need to look
at the different (and contradictory) roles into which junior researchers
are placed.  This is designed to cover people in the range from
research assistant to PhD student to postdocs.</p>
<section id="student">
<h3>Student<a class="headerlink" href="#student" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A student is someone studying to improve their knowledge, often with
their knowledge being evaluated and leading to some sort of recognition.
While not technically true, the joke that postdocs are “super-students
but don’t end up with a degree” is a bit too realistic for comfort.</p>
<p>Advantages: it places the emphasis on self-learning and
self-exploration.  A student can really choose their own path.  In
theory, it produces a credential that will assist in the student’s
future career - in addition to useful knowledge and skills, of course.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: we can sometimes leave people alone too much to do
their own thing, without providing needed advice and direction when it
would be in their own interest.  Being a student also implies some
sort of evaluation/grading, and we don’t like giving negative feedback
to people, so this part can often be lost.  A student needs to be
allowed to fail, otherwise their credentials eventually won’t mean
anything.</p>
</section>
<section id="employee">
<h3>Employee<a class="headerlink" href="#employee" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>An employee works for an employer, and the employer dictates the work,
behavior, tools, working time, and so on.  “Employee vs independent
contractor” is a major point of debate in the current gig economy, so
one can find plenty of information on this topic online <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.  Often times,
researchers have far more freedom than an employee would, sometimes
only rarely working with others in the group on projects, deciding
their own tools, and of course working far more hours than HR thinks
you should.</p>
<aside class="footnote-list brackets">
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="id2" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id1">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>For example US Internal Revenue Service guidelines on employee
vs independent contractor: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762">https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762</a></p>
</aside>
</aside>
<p>Whatever the case, “employee status” provides the most protection for
labor and is often used as (a part of) the hiring model, even if
someone is a student at the same time.</p>
<p>Sometimes researchers might not actually be employees (in the HR
sense), for example if they have an external grant or are unfunded.
In some cases this can cause problems for them.  You should be aware
of this situation and be proactive about any problems that may come
up.</p>
<p>Advantages: provides a strong, well-defined relationship and good
worker protections.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: This model is actually not accurate in many cases,
where the emphasis is on academic freedom and developing one’s own
research program.  HR and legislation, not understanding the true
relationship, may provide a lot of advice that isn’t very relevant to
this reality.  The aspect of student evaluation may be
under-emphasized.  Problems may be passed to HR, when really it should
be handled in an academic sense.</p>
</section>
<section id="independent-contractor">
<h3>Independent contractor<a class="headerlink" href="#independent-contractor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>An independent contractor decides their own projects, tools,
working methods, and schedule - within a goal defined by the party
contracting them.  This sounds a lot more like most researchers that I
know of.  Especially the concept of bringing your own tools
(techniques you know) and methods (how you approach a problem), which
you are likely to have brought from previous jobs and will keep using
in future ones is quite like a freelancer.  This (and the
“entrepreneur” case below) are especially relevant when the researcher
provides their own funding.</p>
<p>Advantages: We accept the amount of freedom and independence
researchers have, and by accepting that, we can better tune our
management to their (and our) needs.  Researchers build up skills and
tools over time and can easily move around, sharing knowledge.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: If this model was the actual legal relationship, it
would be like running one’s own small business which is not a very
stable occupation.  It is harder to run a research group creating
long-term results when everyone can do their own thing, or if they do
focus on a project you want, they might use some incompatible tool
which no one else later can use (un-reproducible research).  It is very
easy to let someone keep doing something unproductive for a very long
time.  Especially when someone provides their own funding, it can be
difficult to provide hard-to-hear advice.</p>
</section>
<section id="entrepreneur">
<h3>Entrepreneur<a class="headerlink" href="#entrepreneur" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Some researchers aim to become group leaders themselves, too.  In
order to do this, you have to practically come up with an idea and
sell it to others in your field, and then sell it to funding agencies.
This is a very, very different skill than what is traditionally
considered part of scientific education.</p>
<p>Advantages: For many people, this level of self-direction (while still
having the protections of an employee) is very appealing.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: there is very little training or support for this.  The
people who can best advance in this system aren’t necessarily the best
scientifically, but the best salespeople.  The tricks of the trade are
often learned passively or inherited through ones advisor.  We could
debate conflicts of interest in a university supporting entrepreneurs
creating their own work to take elsewhere.</p>

<section id="early-career-worker">
<h3>Early-career worker<a class="headerlink" href="#early-career-worker" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Let’s not forget that, in addition to all of the above, young
researchers are essentially brand new people in working life, even if
their title is student.  In any normal company, there is a transition
period between learning theoretical knowledge during studies and being
a productive employee.  This is a quite hands-on, practical, and
mentorship-based kind of activity.  Academic researchers often miss
this type of period and end up having to learn things by themselves
(since as we’ll discuss later, the mentorship often isn’t as great as
it should be).</p>
<p>If this role isn’t properly developed, a researcher may end up years
later without being ready to take any non-academic job at a level
consistent with their experience.</p>

<h2>Roles of a group leader<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-of-a-group-leader" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As a group leader, you will have many different roles.
Traditionallly, many of these are actually not done by the leader, but
instead are handled by others in the group or the broader
department/university.</p>
<section id="funder">
<h3>Funder<a class="headerlink" href="#funder" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>First and most obviously, the group leader serves to get funding for
many of their group members.  Plenty of junior researchers have, or
apply for, their own funding, but in the end this often falls to the
research supervisor if there are no other options (at least in some
fields).</p>
<p>Sometimes, projects can be so diverse that the common funding source
is the only thing bringing people together.</p>
</section>
<section id="employer">
<h3>Employer<a class="headerlink" href="#employer" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The group leader often serves as the supervisor (from a HR sense) of
the group, as the legal representative of the employer.  HR thinks
this means you set the tasks and responsibilities of the employee
(directing work).  See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-roles-of-a-junior-researcher"><span class="doc">Roles of a junior researcher</span></a> for
thoughts on how much this makes sense.</p>
<p>Of course, while an employer <em>can</em> direct work, someone who does
this too much would be considered a very bad supervisor.</p>
</section>
<section id="scientific-advisor">
<h3>Scientific advisor<a class="headerlink" href="#scientific-advisor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A group leader usually advises their group in the scientific topics
needed for projects.  This is a usually a pretty clear role and what
group leaders have been trained for - at least more than anything else
on this page.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-process-mentor">
<h3>Research process mentor<a class="headerlink" href="#research-process-mentor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>

<section id="practical-mentor">
<h3>Practical mentor<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-mentor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There are all types of practical difficulties a young person may have
in life when moving from undergraduate education to something sort-of
like working life.  Young researchers may have few people they can
connect with, especially if they have moved far away.</p>
<p>As an example: at Aalto University (Finland), there are two types of
people: those from Finland, and those not.  Those from Finland have
had everything work perfectly all their life and have plenty of
friends who can help with anything else.  Those not have various
problems and many don’t have that support network.  Like it our not,
these questions end up at the group leader, and the group leader
often provides better service than other official support structures
(even if it’s just by being understanding of the situation).</p>
</section>
<section id="life-coach">
<h3>Life coach<a class="headerlink" href="#life-coach" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A junior researcher often doesn’t know exactly where they want to go
in their life.  Like it or not, most of the senior people they know
are in academia, and thus those people are the life coaches.</p>
</section>
<section id="social-activity-provider">
<h3>Social activity provider<a class="headerlink" href="#social-activity-provider" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This is not exactly a good situation, but for many people, social
activities are focused around the research group.  A group leader
shouldn’t have to take responsibility for this, but sometimes there is
a need of them promoting social activities.  At least they might
encourage their group to provide this…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In some sense, researchers do need to do new things, and starting

learn.</p></li>

<li><p>But on the other hand…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If everyone is re-implementing themselves, how does someone learn
how to do that well?  Do you see good examples to learn from -
that’s the best way to learn.</p></li>
