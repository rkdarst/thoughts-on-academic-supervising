<p>Once you start leading people, you have a different job.  You are no
longer responsible for doing things yourself, but to get the best out
of the people who work for you.  Given the amount of stress and
problems that young researchers tend to have, it’s worth thinking
about this role some.</p>
<p>Academic supervising is a bit unique because it’s a delicate balance
of independence and teaching, of workers who are constantly coming and
going.</p>

<h2>About this guide<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-guide" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Hopefully, this guide becomes the collection of opinions form many
different people.  Below, you can read about the general plan.</p>
<p>This book is focused on (made with the perspective of) technical or
computational sciences (so far?) - a field where junior academics are
basically advancing along a scientific and technical career path at
the same time.</p>
<p>This guide definitely has come controversial takes in it, relative to
many other guides.  This is by design - there are plenty of other
guides you can find, and there’s no need to repeat what’s already
known.  rkdarst’s position also allows more controversial takes than
most people could make.  In some fields, organizations, or countries,
things are probably much better than is described here.  Hopefully,
this is an example of the worst case and you can see much better
things around you.</p>

<h3>Why management?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-management" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once one becomes a leader, one of their responsibility is to get the
best out of the people they lead.  We often hear horror stories about
management, including the joke “the best manager I’ve had is one who
did nothing”.  Still, working life is difficult, especially in
academia, and <em>good</em> management/leadership <em>is</em> actually important
both for students and group leaders.</p>
</section>
<section id="prologue-richard-darst">
<h3>Prologue: Richard Darst<a class="headerlink" href="#prologue-richard-darst" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>(more prologues will be added for other contributors)</p>
<p>If I’ve decided to write all this, maybe I should say why I think
anyone should even bother reading what I’m writing, right?</p>
<p>When I started as a manager, not of research students but of research
staff, I put some thought into understanding what my responsibilities
would be.  What I found wasn’t very pretty: most researchers/students
I knew didn’t have very good managers, I had good supervisors but
perhaps not good managers, and the whole idea of academic management
was vague and unclear.  This leads to catastrophically low
productivity and research output.</p>
<p>Of course, this might be by design: do we want our students and staff
to have the freedom to do what they want and try and fail?  Yes, that
seems like a good idea.  But that doesn’t mean they have to be alone
and without good mentoring.  And if we don’t put in effort in
advising, the outcome of the academic system only reenforces existing
power structures and inequalities in academia.  The mental health
effects of “try and fail” are everywhere and <em>a major crisis</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not a research group leader (professor), but I think that is a
good thing.  Instead, I work as professional university staff
(scientific computing support) and am young enough to still be closely
connected to junior researchers.  In my role as a supporter, I see
(and help with) many of the problems that should be solved at the
group management level, whether they are technical or social.  Since I
have started supervising my own staff, I can connect to best
practices of independent research-type staff.  On top of that, as busy
as I am, I have more time than most group leaders to devote to writing
this.  I won’t know everything, but it’s open source so others can
improve.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that there is a lot that needs to be better.  Probably,
few people will read this, I’m fully aware that the people who most
need to hear these points probably don’t want to (and won’t find
this).  Everyone will need to find their own style, but by writing
down some notes hopefully everyone can be helped to find it.  Equally,
by writing things down, students and research staff can also benefit
by being able to understand different management styles and discuss
what they need with their own advisors (or find a properly matched
advisor in the first place).</p>

administration of organizations</a>.  and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor">A supervisor is

management/supervision in academia is sort of a dirty word, these
should not be intrinsically bad things: a group leader wants their
group to function as best as possible.  It just has to be done
appropriate to the situation.</p>
<p>Lack of good supervision can cause plenty of problems, such as
inefficient work, lack of diversity in academia, and major mental
health problems.</p>

<h2>Roles of a junior researcher<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-of-a-junior-researcher" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In order to understand the difficulty of management in academia, we
need to look at the different (and contradictory) roles into which
junior researchers are placed.  These conflicting roles are probably
the reason that bad management in academia is so pervasive.</p>
<p>This description is designed to cover people in the range from
research assistant to PhD student to postdocs.</p>
<section id="student">
<h3>Student<a class="headerlink" href="#student" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A student is someone studying to improve their knowledge, often with
their knowledge being evaluated and leading to some sort of recognition.
While not technically true, the joke that postdocs are “super-students
but don’t end up with a degree” is a bit too realistic for comfort.</p>
<p>A student can’t leave early without having wasted time by not earning
their degree.  This is a rather precarious position when the student
is entirely dependent on one person, and we’ll come back to this later.</p>
<p>Advantages: it places the emphasis on self-learning and
self-exploration.  A student can really choose their own path.  In
theory, it produces a credential that will assist in the student’s
future career - in addition to useful knowledge and skills, of course.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: we can sometimes leave people alone too much to do
their own thing, without providing needed advice and direction when it
would be in their own interest.  Being a student also implies some
sort of evaluation/scoring, and that a student needs to be
allowed to fail, otherwise their credentials eventually won’t mean
anything.  Since we often don’t like giving negative feedback
to people, so this part can often be lost so that they both don’t get
a negative score (to improve later) and don’t fully succeed.</p>
</section>
<section id="employee">
<h3>Employee<a class="headerlink" href="#employee" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>An employee works for an employer, and the employer dictates the work,
behavior, tools, working time, and so on.  “Employee vs independent
contractor” is a major point of debate in the current gig economy, so
one can find plenty of information on this topic online <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.  Often times,
researchers have far more freedom than an employee would, sometimes
only rarely working with others in the group on projects, deciding
their own tools, and of course working far more hours than HR thinks
you should.  (We discuss this more in the next section on independent
contractors.)</p>
<aside class="footnote-list brackets">
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="id2" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id1">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>For example US Internal Revenue Service guidelines on employee
vs independent contractor: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762">https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762</a></p>
</aside>
</aside>
<p>Whatever the case, “employee status” provides the most protection for
labor and is often used as (a part of) the academic hiring model, even
if someone is a student at the same time.</p>
<p>Sometimes researchers might not actually be employees (in the HR
sense), for example if they have an external grant or are unfunded.
In some cases this can cause problems for them because of missing
labor protections or not being “in the system” like others.  You
should be aware of this situation and be proactive about any problems
that may come up.</p>
<p>Advantages: provides a strong, well-defined relationship and good
worker protections.  Implies that the researcher works for the
organization, thus the organization should help them be as productive
as possible out of their own self-interest.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: This model is actually not accurate in many cases,
where the emphasis is on academic freedom and developing one’s own
research program (see next section).  HR, not understanding the true
relationship, may provide a lot of advice that isn’t very relevant to
this reality while thinking they are doing what is needed - leaving a
vacuum if there is no other outside support.  Employment contract and
study periods may be un-synced.  The aspect of student evaluation may
be under-emphasized.  Problems may be passed to HR, when really it
should be handled in an academic sense.  Labor legislation tries to
impose a structure which just doesn’t match reality, leading to
ignoring (at best) or actively fighting against other actually
important rules at worse.</p>
<p>In short, HR (actually “employee relations” in a university)can’t
provided everything needed for your group’s support needs.</p>
</section>
<section id="independent-contractor">
<h3>Independent contractor<a class="headerlink" href="#independent-contractor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>An independent contractor decides their own projects, tools, working
methods, and schedule - within a goal defined by the party contracting
them.  This sounds a lot like most researchers that I know of.
Especially the concept of bringing your own tools (techniques you
know) and methods (how you approach a problem), which you are likely
to have brought from previous jobs and will keep using in future ones
is quite like a freelancer.  An academic often has the freedom to
decline projects they don’t like.  This (and the “entrepreneur” case below)
are especially relevant when the researcher provides their own
funding.</p>
<p>TODO: Employee vs independent contractor table</p>
<p>Advantages: We accept the amount of freedom and independence
researchers have, and by accepting that, we can better tune our
management to their (and our) needs.  We realize that we suggest, not
tell, most of the time.  Researchers build up skills and
tools over time and can easily move around, sharing knowledge.  The
independent contractor model acknowledges mobility.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: If this model was the actual legal relationship, it
would be like running one’s own small business which is not a very
stable occupation and a very hard life (actually… academics have a
pretty hard life due to instability.  That’s the point, isn’t it?).
It is harder to run a research group creating long-term results when
everyone can do their own thing, or if they do focus on a project you
want, they might use some incompatible tool which no one else later
can use (un-reproducible research).  It is very easy to let someone
keep doing something unproductive for a very long time, since after
all, you can’t tell them what to do (and you just hire someone else
next time).  Especially when someone provides their own funding, it
can be difficult to provide hard-to-hear negative feedback.</p>
</section>
<section id="entrepreneur">
<h3>Entrepreneur<a class="headerlink" href="#entrepreneur" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Some researchers aim to become group leaders themselves, too.  In
order to do this, you have to practically come up with an idea and
sell it to others in your field, and then sell it to funding agencies.
This is a very, very different skill than what is traditionally
considered part of scientific education.  It is a very different skill
than being an employee.  You could say that most of academic is built
around this selling.</p>
<p>Advantages: For many people, this level of self-direction (while still
having the protections of an employee) is very appealing.  It gives
the freedom everyone wants.  It makes it very clear that to succeed,
you need to sell your ideas to others.  Competition gives the best ideas.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: There is very little training or support for this.  The
people who can best advance in this system aren’t necessarily the best
scientifically, but the best salespeople.  The tricks of the trade are
often learned passively or inherited through ones advisor, or not at
all.  We could debate conflicts of interest in a university supporting
entrepreneurs creating their own work to take elsewhere. Competition
holds everyone back.</p>
</section>
<section id="early-career-worker">
<h3>Early-career worker<a class="headerlink" href="#early-career-worker" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Let’s not forget that, in addition to all of the above, young
researchers are essentially brand new people in working life, even if
their title is student.  In any normal company, there is a transition
period between learning theoretical knowledge during studies and being
a productive employee.  This is a quite hands-on, practical, and
mentorship-based kind of activity.  Academic researchers often miss
this type of period and end up having to learn to be self-sufficient
by themselves even if this is what we hope the young period provides
(since as we’ll discuss later, the mentorship often isn’t as great as
it should be).</p>
<p>If this aspect isn’t properly considered, a researcher may end up years
later without being ready to take any non-academic job at a level
consistent with their experience - since they aren’t prepared for any
other working life.</p>

<h2>Roles of a group leader<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-of-a-group-leader" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As a group leader, you will have many different roles.
Traditionallly, many of these are actually not done by the leader, but
instead are handled by others in the group or the broader
department/university.  These roles don’t contradict each other as
much as those of a junior researcher.</p>
<section id="funder">
<h3>Funder<a class="headerlink" href="#funder" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>First and most obviously, the group leader serves to get funding for
many of their group members.  Plenty of junior researchers have, or
apply for, their own funding, but in the end, in some fields, this
falls to the research supervisor if there are no other options.</p>
<p>Sometimes, projects can be so diverse that the common funding source
is the only thing bringing people together.</p>
<p>Easy because: Funding makes the leadership and supervision clear.  It
provides clear motivation for good supervision.  It provides a clear
connection between people.  It (usually) makes the junior research an
employee, which provides good labor protections.</p>
<p>Hard because: It’s stressful if someone needs funding, but there is
not any.</p>
</section>
<section id="employer">
<h3>Employer<a class="headerlink" href="#employer" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The group leader often serves as the supervisor (from a HR point of
view) of the group, as the legal representative of the employer.  HR
thinks this means you set the tasks and responsibilities of the
employee (directing work).  See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-roles-of-a-junior-researcher"><span class="doc">Roles of a junior researcher</span></a>
for thoughts on how much this makes sense.  Being the HR-related
supervisor might be the only task a supervisor is actually required
to do.</p>
<p>Of course, while an supervisor-employer <em>can</em> direct work, someone who
does this too much would be considered a bad academic supervisor.
Someone that is hands-off is usually considered good (but hopefully
this book gives some reasons why being too hands-off is bad).</p>
<p>Easy because: HR prepares you and tells you what to do.  It’s a
clearly legally defined relationship.  You can tell people what to do
if needed.</p>
<p>Difficult because: Researchers don’t want to be treated as employees.</p>
</section>
<section id="employee">
<h3>Employee<a class="headerlink" href="#employee" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Let’s not forget that a supervisor is also an employee of the
organization (usually).  In theory, this means that practices come
from the organization, through the supervisor, to the employees.  This
can be much more loose in practice - it’s almost like each research
group is its own startup.  (Look for horror stories of chaotic employment
practices in startups and see how similar it feels.)</p>

<h3>Scientific advisor<a class="headerlink" href="#scientific-advisor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A group leader usually advises their group in the scientific topics
needed for projects.  This is a usually a pretty clear role and what
group leaders have been trained for - at least more than anything else
on this page.  It can be a delicate balance between advisory and
letting people learn themselves.</p>
<p>Easy because: It’s what you have the most experience in.  You have
experience receiving scientific advice.  It’s expected.</p>
<p>Hard because: You don’t want to tell people “no”.  It’s opinion
based.  It’s hard to measure if the advice is good or not.</p>

<h3>Practical mentor<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-mentor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There are all types of practical difficulties a young person may have
in life when moving from undergraduate education to something sort-of
like working life.  Young researchers may have few people they can
connect with, especially if they have moved far away.</p>
<p>As an example: at Aalto University (Finland), there are two types of
people: those from Finland, and those not.  Those from Finland have
had everything work perfectly all their life and have plenty of
friends who can help with anything else.  Those not have various
problems and many don’t have that support network.  Like it our not,
these questions end up at the group leader, and the group leader
often provides better service than other official support structures
(even if it’s just by being understanding of the situation).</p>
<p>Easy because: ??</p>
<p>Hard because: You don’t want to take on any more tasks.  Opinion
based.  Different experiences.</p>

are in academia, and thus those people are the life coaches.</p>

<h3>Social activity provider<a class="headerlink" href="#social-activity-provider" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This is not exactly a good situation, but for many people, social
activities are focused around the research group.  A group leader
shouldn’t have to take responsibility for this, but sometimes there is
a need of them promoting social activities.  At least they might
encourage their group to provide this…</p>
<p>Easy because: If you are also young, you might want to do social
activities anyway.</p>
<p>Hard because: You don’t have time.  You might not want to get too
close to your students.  Might have different interests.</p>

<li><p>Academic supervisors are usually extremely busy.</p></li>
<li><p>Supervisors are sometimes min-maxed to producing articles at the
cost of other skills.</p></li>
