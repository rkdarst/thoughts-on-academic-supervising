Group meetings
==============

* What's the point of a group meeting?

  * Learning how to present?
  * Reading journal articles?
  * Learning how to research?

* Most of my past research group meetings have been rather
  uneducational - the focus has been presenting something that looks
  good (in other words, presentation practice), rather than a time to
  focus on learning how to get those results better.

* Often there can be a pressure to look good and hide the parts that
  didn't work well (= the most education parts).

* Can group meetings become a time to learn from each other, not a
  chore to attend and something that induces stress to prepare for?
