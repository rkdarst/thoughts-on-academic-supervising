Working together
================

* We say that research groups should work together, but do the get the
  benefits of working together?

  * Working together isn't simply delegating the supervision, but can
    be real close-together co-working.

* Working together can provide enough knowledge and experience to be
  one of the most important forms of education.  TODO: percents of
  learning things.

* Far too often, I don't see this working-together that happens often
  enough (and in enough detail) to provide good mentorship.

* Is our physical environment arranged to work together?

  * Desks right next to each other - can easily see each other's
    screens without moving.

  * Low threshold to share screen/notes and discuss as things are
    being developed.

* Is the overall environment good for learning from each other?

  * Is everyone focused only on their own first-author papers?

  * Is teamwork celebrated?

  * Are mistakes and "show me the unfinished work" encouraged?

* Does your group have a culture of hiding their work until things are
  perfect (= few opportunities to learn together) or bringing people
  in while they are still developing?
