Management antipatterns
=======================

Sink or swim
------------

* Well, if given enough time they'll eventually figure it out.  It's
  not my job to hold someone's hand.

Rich get richer
---------------

* We want the best return of our investment, so we invest our time and
  energy into the people who seem to have the best chances of big
  success.


My group will mentor itself
---------------------------

* My undergraduate researchers will learn from my PhD students.
* My PhDs will learn from my postdocs.
* My postdocs are already independent.
* Great, I don't need to do anything!


Talk about science, not about tools
-----------------------------------

* Talking about the research results (pretty presentations), not about
  how you got them (the real problems).  Yet in theory we are supposed
  to learn *how* to do that research here.
