Labor freedom
=============

This is a very serious section: are labor practices good in academia?

* Is a student dependent on only one person?

  * They have only one advisor.  If the main advisor decides to stop
    giving good advice for any reason, there are few people they could
    support. (The supervisor could do only the minimum and leave the
    student to figure things out themselves.)

* Is a student free to leave?

  * Academia is close-knit, there is a feeling of "I don't want to
    take students from others in my field" because it may seem like
    poaching.  Thus, the ability to change supervisors is much more
    limited than other forms of work.

  * They may have spent years working towards a degree, which they
    lose progress if they leave their degree early.  If they have not
    gotten employable skills outside of academia, their situation
    becomes even more stressful.  Maybe they don't even know how to
    leave.

* Combined, this means that junior researchers are in a very
  precarious position.
