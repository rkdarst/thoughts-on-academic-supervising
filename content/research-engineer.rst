Designed research engineer
==========================

What is a research engineer?
----------------------------

* Someone that works on making research work well, not simply focused
  on making the next academic level or getting more first author
  papers.
* Thus, they are designed to help grow your research and can mentor in
  research processes.
* Example: `Aalto Research Software Engineers
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/>`__ do this and explicitly try to
  mentor in  best practices.



Research engineers to support your group
----------------------------------------

* But you can also hire people with the explicit purpose of supporting
  your other researchers, instead of someone with the goal of
  advancing their own career.
