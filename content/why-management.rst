Why management?
===============


Get the most out of your group
------------------------------

* You want to succeed, that means your group needs to succeed
* People can and will struggle without you


Societal impact
---------------

* Are you just trying to race for promotions or do you also want to
  improve society?



Improve the quality of life for your group
------------------------------------------

* People struggling aren't happy
* People not happy can't be as productive


Avoid "rich get richer"
-----------------------

* Academia is know for its many diversity problems
* If you let people figure it out, the ones with their own support
  network will tend to succeed more.
* This probably isn't what you want.  But it might be what you get if
  you don't pay attention.
