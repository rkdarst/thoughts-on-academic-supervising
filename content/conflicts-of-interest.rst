Conflicts of interest
=====================

* Do the interests of the supervisor and junior researcher align?

  * As was discussed in :doc:`survivor-bias`, group leaders are not
    representative of the careers of most junior researchers.

  * Even without this, there are many times when there can be
    conflicts of interest between the supervisor and the person
    supervised.

* **Conflict of interest**: TODO definition

* Publications for group leader vs publications for junior researcher

  * Group leader wants a pattern of groundbreaking results.

  * Yet most junior researchers just need to get things out.

* Exclusive focus on publications

  * Should a group leader always advise focusing on publications
    (since that's what benefits themselves) when rounding out one's
    skills could be more useful for the average person?

* Will a supervisor pay the most attention to those who care about an
  academic career track?
