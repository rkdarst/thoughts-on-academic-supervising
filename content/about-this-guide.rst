About this guide
================

Hopefully, this guide becomes the collection of opinions form many
different people.  Below, you can

This book is focused on technical or computational sciences (so far?).


Prologue: Richard Darst
-----------------------

When I started as a manager, not of research students but of research
staff, I put some thought into understanding what my responsibilities
would be.  What I found wasn't very pretty: most researchers/students
I know didn't have very good managers, I had good supervisors but
perhaps not good managers, and the whole idea of academic management
was vague and unclear.  This leads to catastrophically low
productivity and research output.

Of course, this might be by design: do we want our students and staff
to have the freedom to do what they want and try and fail?  Yes, that
seems like a good idea.  But that doesn't mean they have to be alone
and without good mentoring.  And if we don't put in effort in
advising, the outcome of the academic system only reenforces existing
power structures and inequalities in academia.

I'm not a research group leader (professor), but I think that is a
good thing.  Instead, I work as professional university staff
(scientific computing support) and am young enough to still be closely
connected to junior researchers.  In my role as a supporter, I see
(and help with) many of the problems that should be solved at the
group management level, whether they are technical or social.  Since I
have started supervising my own staff, I can really connect to best
practices of research-type staff.  On top of that, as busy as I am, I
have more time than most group leaders to devote to writing this.  I
won't know everything, but it's open source so others can improve.

I'm convinced that there is a lot that needs to be better.  Everyone
will need to find their own style, but by writing down some notes
hopefully everyone can be helped to find it.  Equally, by writing
things down, students and research staff can also benefit by being
able to understand different management styles and discuss what they
need with their own advisors (or find a properly matched advisor in
the first place).



How it is made
--------------

The intention is that this is an open-source project, with many
different opinions.  Of course, since many things contained in it are
opinions, it is a rather interesting open-source project.  For now,
most of the content is the result of one author, but as time goes on
this page will be changed to reflect reality.  Major contributors can
add their own epilogues for this page.

It is best to assume that any good ideas come from other contributors
and any bad ideas come from the initial author rkdarst.

This is very much a work in progress and nothing is complete or
proofread.
