Roles of a group leader
=======================

As a group leader, you will have many different roles.
Traditionallly, many of these are actually not done by the leader, but
instead are handled by others in the group or the broader
department/university.  These roles don't contradict each other as
much as those of a junior researcher.


Funder
------

First and most obviously, the group leader serves to get funding for
many of their group members.  Plenty of junior researchers have, or
apply for, their own funding, but in the end, in some fields, this
falls to the research supervisor if there are no other options.

Sometimes, projects can be so diverse that the common funding source
is the only thing bringing people together.

Easy because: Funding makes the leadership and supervision clear.  It
provides clear motivation for good supervision.  It provides a clear
connection between people.  It (usually) makes the junior research an
employee, which provides good labor protections.

Hard because: It's stressful if someone needs funding, but there is
not any.


Employer
--------

The group leader often serves as the supervisor (from a HR point of
view) of the group, as the legal representative of the employer.  HR
thinks this means you set the tasks and responsibilities of the
employee (directing work).  See :doc:`roles-of-a-junior-researcher`
for thoughts on how much this makes sense.  Being the HR-related
supervisor might be the only task a supervisor is actually required
to do.

Of course, while an supervisor-employer *can* direct work, someone who
does this too much would be considered a bad academic supervisor.
Someone that is hands-off is usually considered good (but hopefully
this book gives some reasons why being too hands-off is bad).

Easy because: HR prepares you and tells you what to do.  It's a
clearly legally defined relationship.  You can tell people what to do
if needed.

Difficult because: Researchers don't want to be treated as employees.


Employee
--------

Let's not forget that a supervisor is also an employee of the
organization (usually).  In theory, this means that practices come
from the organization, through the supervisor, to the employees.  This
can be much more loose in practice - it's almost like each research
group is its own startup.  (Look for horror stories of chaotic employment
practices in startups and see how similar it feels.)


Scientific advisor
------------------

A group leader usually advises their group in the scientific topics
needed for projects.  This is a usually a pretty clear role and what
group leaders have been trained for - at least more than anything else
on this page.  It can be a delicate balance between advisory and
letting people learn themselves.

Easy because: It's what you have the most experience in.  You have
experience receiving scientific advice.  It's expected.

Hard because: You don't want to tell people "no".  It's opinion
based.  It's hard to measure if the advice is good or not.


Research process mentor
-----------------------

A group leader usually advises their group in the process (social
side) of doing their projects: how to approach projects, the
publication process, collaborations, and so on.  Group leaders have
usually have training here.

Easy because: You have experience in this.  It's expected.

Hard because: Most of this is "word of mouth".


Practical mentor
----------------

There are all types of practical difficulties a young person may have
in life when moving from undergraduate education to something sort-of
like working life.  Young researchers may have few people they can
connect with, especially if they have moved far away.

As an example: at Aalto University (Finland), there are two types of
people: those from Finland, and those not.  Those from Finland have
had everything work perfectly all their life and have plenty of
friends who can help with anything else.  Those not have various
problems and many don't have that support network.  Like it our not,
these questions end up at the group leader, and the group leader
often provides better service than other official support structures
(even if it's just by being understanding of the situation).

Easy because: ??

Hard because: You don't want to take on any more tasks.  Opinion
based.  Different experiences.


Life coach
----------

A junior researcher often doesn't know exactly where they want to go
in their life.  Like it or not, most of the senior people they know
are in academia, and thus those people are the life coaches.



Social activity provider
------------------------

This is not exactly a good situation, but for many people, social
activities are focused around the research group.  A group leader
shouldn't have to take responsibility for this, but sometimes there is
a need of them promoting social activities.  At least they might
encourage their group to provide this...

Easy because: If you are also young, you might want to do social
activities anyway.

Hard because: You don't have time.  You might not want to get too
close to your students.  Might have different interests.
