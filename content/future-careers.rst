Diversity of future careers
===========================

Your career isn't typical
-------------------------

* As discussed in :doc:`survivor-bias`.
* You probably need to prepare most of your research group for careers
  other than yours.


Not every junior researcher will continue in academia
-----------------------------------------------------

* If someone doesn't want to, or isn't sure, they will feel alone.
* Feel unprepared for future jobs.  Maybe no one they can turn to for
  help.
* Feel like a failure.


How you can help
----------------

* Diversity of collaborators and colleagues from different career
  paths.
* Actually discuss career paths.
* Don't just hire people who have taken the same path to get where
  they are now.  This provides internal role models.
