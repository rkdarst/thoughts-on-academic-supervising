Weekly (personal) meetings
==========================

* Meet one-on-one with each junior researcher - once a week(?), at
  least when they are new.
* Focus on academic process and life, *not* discussing research.
  Basically, the time to provide more help in more broad problems.
* Should this be combined with a periodic research discussion?  In
  theory now, but in practice you may not have time to do anything
  else, and thus you have to.

  * If it is combined, the research discussion will often eventually
    dominate the whole conversation, making something not very useful.

  * Plus, research discussions should be something that more people
    can attend, while weekly personal meetings should be private.
