Roles of a junior researcher
============================

In order to understand the difficulty of management, we need to look
at the different (and contradictory) roles which junior researchers
are put into.  This is designed to cover people in the range from
research assistant to PhD student to postdocs.

Student
-------

A student is someone studying to improve their knowledge, often with
their knowledge being evaluated and leading to some sort of degree.
While not technically true, the joke that postdocs are "super-students
but don't end up with a degree" is a bit too realistic for comfort.

Advantages: it places the emphasis on self-learning and
self-exploration.  A student can really choose their own path.

Disadvantages: we can sometimes leave people alone too much to do
their own thing, without providing needed advice and direction when it
would be in their own interest.  Being a student also implies some
sort of evaluation/grading, and we don't like giving negative feedback
to people, so this part can often be lost.



Employee
--------

An employee works for an employer, and the employer dictates the work,
behavior, tools, working time, and so on.  "Employee vs independent
contractor" is a major point of debate in the current gig economy, so
one can find plenty of information on this topic online [1]_.  Often times,
researchers have far more freedom than an employee would, sometimes
only rarely working with others in the group on projects, deciding
their own tools, and of course working far more hours than HR thinks
you should.

       vs independent contractor: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762

Whatever the case, "employee" provides the most protection for staff
and is often used as (a part of) the hiring model, even if they are a
student at the same time.

Sometimes researchers might not actually be employees (in the HR
sense), for example if they have an external grant or are unfunded.
In some cases this can cause problems for them.  You should be aware
of this situation and ask about what other problems may come up.

Advantages: provides a strong, well-defined relationship and good
worker protections.

Disadvantages: This model is actually not accurate in many cases,
where the emphasis is on academic freedom and developing one's own
research program.  HR, not understanding the true relationship, may
provide a lot of advice that isn't very relevant to the reality.  The
aspect of student evaluation may be under-emphasized.



Independent contractor
----------------------

An independent contractor decides their own projects, tools, and
working methods.  This sounds a lot more like most researchers that I
know of.  Especially the concept of bringing your own tools
(techniques you know) and methods (how you approach a problem), which
you are likely to have brought from previous jobs and will keep using
in future ones is quite like a freelancer.

Advantages: We accept the amount of freedom and independence
researchers have, and by accepting that, we can better tune our
management to their (and our) needs.

Disadvantages: There are very few protections, and if this model was
actually used, it would be like they are running their own small
business which is not a very stable occupation.  It is harder to run a
research group creating long-term results when everyone can do their
own thing, or if they do focus on a project you want, they might use
some incompatible tool which no one else later can use.  It is very
easy to let someone keep doing something unproductive for a very long
time.



Entrepreneur
------------

Some researchers aim to become group leaders themselves, too.  In
order to do this, you have to practically come up with an idea and
sell it to others in your filed, and then sell it to funding agencies.
This is a very, very different skill thanwhat is traditionally
considered part of scientific education.

Advantages: For many people, this level of self-direction (while still
having the protections of an employee) is very appealing.

Disadvantages: there is very little training or support for this.  The
people who can best advance in this system aren't necessarily the best
scientifically, but the best salespeople.  The tricks of the trade are
often learned passively or inherited through ones advisor.
