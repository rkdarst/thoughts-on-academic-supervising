Mentoring roles
===============

* Academic supervisors are usually extremely busy.
* Supervisors are sometimes min-maxed to producing articles at the
  cost of other skills.
* This leads to a situation where the supervisor can't provide all of
  the needed mentoring.  Maybe they can give a great idea and write a
  good people, but not tell someone which tools to use to do it well.


What is a research engineer?
----------------------------

* Someone that works on making research work well, not simply focused
  on making the next academic level or getting more first author
  papers.
* So they have time and freedom to do useful mentoring.
* Thus, they are designed to help grow your research and can mentor in
  research processes.
* Common names: Staff Scientist, Laboratory manager, Research Software
  Engineer.
* Have time to co-work rather than just tell people what to do and
  wish good luck at it.


Research engineers to support your group
----------------------------------------

* But you can also hire people with the explicit purpose of supporting
  your other researchers, instead of someone with the goal of
  advancing their own career.
* HR may not allow this since they don't fit in the hierarchy.
* You probably can't do what is suggested here, but it's something to
  think about.
