The book `The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating
Growth and Change
<https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/>`__
by Camille Fournier served as inspiration for this guide.  In fact,
you could go so far as to say that most of the basic ideas of this
guide come from here, with added commentary and interpretation for the
academic setting.
