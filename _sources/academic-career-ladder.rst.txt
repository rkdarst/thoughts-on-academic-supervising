Academic career ladder
======================

As described before in chapter :doc:`level-n-plus-one`, people learn
slowly and need time to experience something before they can do it
alone or mentor it..  Each academic level has direct and indirect
lessons that are being learned.

* Higher levels can often be "sink or swim or be well connected
  already".
* This section might also someday consider junior career paths in
  industry and analyze how it corresponds to academia, and what we can
  learn from that comparison.


Why you need to care
--------------------

* Be aware of what people know and are learning.
* The steps someone goes through

  * Sees it done
  * Modify and improve it
  * Do it yourself
  * Improve the process yourself

* Since different people come from different locations, they may be at
  slightly different points on the career ladder.

What you can do
---------------

* Don't have someone mentor or supervise something they have only
  learned how to do recently.  If they have a bit more experience,
  they might be able to mentor it with help.

* Be aware that everyone may have different backgrounds and may be at
  different points of their education, even if they are at a similar
  academic position.

* Sometimes you get put into a position where someone comes in and
  lower on the skills latter than they should be.
