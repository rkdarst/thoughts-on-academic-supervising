Survivorship bias
=================

What is survivor bias?
----------------------

According to Wikipedia, `Survivorship bias or survival bias is the
logical error of concentrating on entities that passed a selection
process while overlooking those that did not
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias>`__.  In the context
of this book, the point is that the supervisors and academic
leadership is a biased sample of the audience which they are leading.


Survivor bias in academia
-------------------------

* How many equally-qualified people didn't make it, so that you could?
* How many jobs are gotten by "waiting around until you get it"?
* Are group leaders representative of junior researchers?
* Not everyone can afford to wait around for something to come up.
  This biases who can even think about getting a job.
* Do you need to think more about how others are experiencing in their
  careers?


Reducing survivor bias
----------------------

* I probably can't say much here - others probably comment on things
  much better than I could.
* Be aware that it exists.  Make sure that there are other role models and
  you put in extra effort to understanding experiences that are
  different than yours.
* The next chapter, :doc:`future-careers`, discusses this more.
