Weekly (personal) meetings
==========================

This section is not about routine meetings that talk about scientific,
research, or teaching topics.  This is about process: how's it going,
do you have the tools needed, is your process going OK?  Not "is work
going OK" but "do you have what is needed right now?"

* Meet one-on-one with each junior researcher - once a week(?), at
  least when they are new.
* Focus on academic process and life, *not* discussing research.
  Basically, the time to provide more help in more broad problems.
* Should this be combined with a periodic research discussion?  In
  theory now, but in practice you may not have time to do anything
  else, and thus you have to.

  * If it is combined, the research discussion will often eventually
    dominate the whole conversation, making something not very useful.

  * Plus, research discussions should be something that more people
    can attend, while weekly personal meetings should be private.

* This may also be considered in some sort of periodic "development
  discussions" which happen once or several times a year.


What you should do
------------------

* At least, make sure that your meetings are not only about discussing
  the scientific side.  Bring up the bigger picture sometimes.
* Take your development discussions seriously, but for young
  researchers they are not often enough.



Kinds of questions to ask
-------------------------

* Are you adapting well?
* Do you have everything that is needed to do your job?
* Is there anyone you would like to work with more?  Is there anything
  that someone else should do differently?
