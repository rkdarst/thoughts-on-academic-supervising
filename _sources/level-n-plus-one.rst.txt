n vs n+1 theory
===============

The theory
----------

* When you are expected to do *n*, you are still learning it and
  probably not very competent.  You still need guidance.
* When you learn *n+1*, then you start to understand how *n* really
  works.
* Example: after taking calculus, you might be able to do problems,
  but not apply it independently.  Then, you take differential
  equations, and start to understand calculus much better.  Maybe you
  can actually apply calculus yourself to some new problems.  But
  differential equations are still hard after that course.
* People should go beyond the bare minimum to achieve competence.


Application to supervising
--------------------------

* Don't expect a person at level *n* to be able to do the level *n*
  things all alone: they still need *very* active support (unless you
  aren't using the "sink or swim" strategy).
* Example: Don't expect a fresh PhD student to be able to mentor a
  masters thesis, even if the PhD student just finished their thesis.
* Don't assume that just because someone has their PhD, they can
  mentor other PhDs.  And so on.  Do these people even have enough
  full example of the PhD process?  Are they prepared to handle unique
  situations?  Can they prepare their mentees for what comes after the
  immediate goal?
* See the levels in chapter :doc:`academic-career-ladder` for
  discussion of what happens at each level.


What to do
----------

- Don't rely on someone who has just accomplished *n* to supervise
  someone working on *n*.
- Provide active "how to mentor others" support for people at all
  levels.
