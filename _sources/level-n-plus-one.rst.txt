n vs n+1 theory
===============

* When you are expected to do *n*, you are still learning it and
  probably not very competent.  You still need guidance.
* When you learn *n+1*, then you start to understand how *n* really
  works.
* Example: after taking calculus, you might be able to do problems,
  but not apply it independently.  Then, you take differential
  equations, and start to understand calculus much better.  But
  differential equations are still hard after that course.  People
  should

Application to academics
------------------------

* Don't expect a person at level *n* to be able to do the level *n*
  things all alone: they still need *very* active support if you
  aren't using the "sink or swim" strategy.
* Don't assume that just because someone has their PhD, they can
  mentor other PhDs.  And so on.  Do these people even have enough
  full example of the PhD process?  Are they prepared to handle unique
  situations?
